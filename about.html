    <h2>About this page</h2>
    <p>
        English translations of Japanese songs aren't often singable. For this they have to keep the same (or close to the same) syllable count in each line, and stressed syllables should be similar as well.
    </p>
<p>
The goal for these translations is to be as accurate as possible while also being singable in a way that sounds similar to the original. Usually this involves coming up with a bunch of extra syllables for the English version but hopefully without altering the meaning much.
