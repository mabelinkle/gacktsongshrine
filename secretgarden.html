Floating along inside of the glass, with both the pupils of my eyes I 
Was only watching you

Can't even see a tiny fragment of kindness
Perpetually repeating traffic signals
As you continued to talk, but only with your mouth, oh baby
All over me, had these all over my body
Removed the plugs, and with these legs just once more
I turned to gaze upon, to gaze upon the sky

Oh, in the dream inside of me, the expanding world is the last secret garden, the last secret garden
Oh, even now inside of you, I am disappearing but you will not forget
My name will be remaining

In this continually warping space in time
Right in my back you stabbed the knife into me - I turned it into wings
And I keep looking at the sky
All over me, had these all over my body
Conduits of memories, the only thing it took to burn it all down
Was just to look at you...

Oh, within arm's reach from me, the expanding world is the last secret garden, the last secret garden
Oh, even now inside of you, I am disappearing but you will not forget
The times that we embraced

Softly, just close your eyes
To shut the light out would be fine you see
If you would like to dream a dream

"But you have already noticed..."
Above your head, your arms flung open wide, everything about you, oh

Oh, in the dream inside of me, the expanding world is the last secret garden, the last secret garden
Oh, even now inside of you, I am disappearing but you will not forget
My name will be there

Oh, within arm's reach from me, the expanding world is the last secret garden
I only looked at you...
The last secret garden
Oh, only you...
