Kaze no koe wo kiita
Yume no tsuzuki wo shiritakute
Daremo oshiete wa kurenai
Mune ga akaku somatta...

Kimi dake ni wa wakatte ite hoshii
Kaeranakereba ikenai koto wo...

Kono doko mademo tsuzuku shiroi daichi wa tooku
Mou harisakebu koe wa dare ni mo todokanai

Kono karada no itami wo kakusu you ni
Sora kara no yasashisa ni dakare...

Sono hitomi ni utsuru tsuki ga kirei de
Tatoe yoru ga owaranakutemo

Kono doko mademo tsuzuku shiroi daichi wa tooku
Mou harisakebu koe wa dare ni mo todokanai
Kono doko mademo tsuzuku shiroi daichi wa fukaku
Mata ochite yuku boku wa dare ni mo iyasenai

Sono chiisana karada wo tsutsumu you ni
Sekirei no yasashisa ni dakare...

Sora kara no yasashisa to tomo ni nemutte
Daichi no nukumori ni dakare...

I heard it.. the voice of the wind talk
I want to know the ending of the dream I had
Nobody wants to help me out with an answer
My chest is stained entirely deep red...

Oh, for you dear I want, want at least for you to understand
Why I have to go back, I just need for you to know

Oh how the forever reaching white mountain covered earth just seems so endless
Although I scream at the top of my lungs nobody else can even hear me

As if to try to hide this body's pain that I feel inside
I am embraced now with kindness from the gentle sky

Twinkling in your eyes, how the moonlight was so beautiful then
Even if it would seem that the night is never done

Oh how the forever reaching white mountain covered earth just seems so endless
Although I scream at the top of my lungs nobody else can even hear me
Oh how the forever reaching white mountain covered earth seems endlessly deep
And now I'm falling again and this time there's not a single soul to save me

As if to try to feel this body's warmth in its tiny frame
I am embraced now with kindness from the lil' wagtail

With the kindness now from the gentle sky I will sleep, I'll close my eyes
I feel the warmth of the earth now too, it holds me...
